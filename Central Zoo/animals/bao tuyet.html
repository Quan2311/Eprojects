    <h2>What are Snow Leopards?</h2>
    <p>Snow Leopards are large cats native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. They are well-adapted to living in cold, harsh environments and are known for their thick fur coats and long tails, which they use for balance. Snow Leopards are considered an endangered species due to habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans.</p>
